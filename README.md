## Why we do this

The number of cases of the novel coronavirus across the globe crossed the 1 million- mark as the global death toll rose to over 45,000. In India, the number of cases climbed to 2,301 and the death toll to 56. (As of 3rd April)

With the active support of the people, we can contain the spread of the virus. The most important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens with the right information and taking precautions.

We have created some infographics that provide powerful insights into this.
